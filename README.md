# Forgotten Potatoes Client
Welcome to my backend capstone Forgotten Potatoes! The goal of this application was to create a straightforward food tracker so that users can branch out when selecting items as they go to the same restaurants frequently. 

The idea came to mind because I tend to go to restaurants enough but always forget what I ate the last time I was there. So wouldn't it be nice to just open up an app, see what you ate last time, and if you liked it? That's what Forgotten Potatoes is all about.

### Stretch Goals
**Create Restaurant Users**
Restaurants will be able to get anonymous informative reports on their menu items to improve the quality of their food. Security protocols will keep all of the information secure so that Restaurant Users will only get ratings and comments.
